                    The easiest and most impactful way to soften, add style,
                    warmth and comfort to a room is with the simple solution of
                    well designed curtains. However, prior to adding curtains to
                    a room, there are many decisions to be made. To make this
                    easier, we have curated some collections for you, which are
                    available as sample boxes to allow you to see the products
                    in your home.
                </Typography>

            <Grid item style={{ paddingBottom: "5%" }}>
